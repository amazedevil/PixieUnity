This is code for linking Unity project with [Pixie](https://github.com/amazedevil/Pixie) based server.

## Installation

You can take latest .unitypackage from [Releases](https://github.com/amazedevil/PixieUnity/releases), or just copy needed files from Assets/PixieUnity folder. PixieUnity depends on NetonsoftJson, so if you already use one, don't import/copy "Newtonsoft.Json.dll".

## How to use

For usage example, you can use [Pixie Quick start guide](https://github.com/amazedevil/Pixie/blob/master/README.md#quick-start), or take a look at example project (development in progress)
